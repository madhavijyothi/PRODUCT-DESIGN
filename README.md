# PRODUCT-DESIGN
Design thinking

Definitions used in traffic signal timing have resulted in some confusion. In many cases, “the old way of doing things” confounds the ability of the industry to educate people new to the field.  Most signal designs and all controllers sold today provide eight standard phases within the signal controller; however, a four-phase intersection is commonly referred to in the literature to represent a standard four-legged intersection with protected left turns on all approaches. It is the intent of this document to reduce the ambiguous use of the term “phase” and for the purposes of this document, a phase is defined as a controller timing unit associated with the control of one or more movements. Each phase at an intersection has a set of timing, possibly containing vehicle and pedestrian timing. A phase may control both a through movement and a right turn movement on an approach.

The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices(MUTCD) defines a signal phase as the right-of-way, yellow change, and red clearance intervals in a cycle that are assigned to an independent traffic movement or combination of traffic movements.

Two additional terms that are important for improving the use of terminology within the signal timing industry is to articulate is the use of movement and interval. A movement reflects the user perspective and is defined by the user type and the action that is taken (turning movement for a vehicle or pedestrian crossing). Two different types of movements include those that have the right of way and those that must yield consistent with the rules of the road or the Uniform Vehicle Code.

A simple example of the concept of movements is the intersection of one-way streets shown in Figure 1. In this example, the intersection is operated by two phases (2 and 4) and pedestrians are accommodated as concurrent movements to the traffic. Phase 2 will include a through and a right turn movement, while phase 4 will have a through and a left turn movement (appropriate turning movements are omitted from the diagram for simplicity). The right turn on phase 2 must yield to pedestrian traffic crossing the west leg of the intersection.

# The movements served at an intersection can be categorized by the various users:

vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit. Figure 4-2 illustrates the typical vehicle and pedestrian movements at a four-leg intersection. In the context of this figure, bicycle and transit movements track the same paths as vehicle movements.

These movements are regulated by the signal controller through their allocation to one or more signal phases. The following list defines some of the terms used to describe vehicle and pedestrian phasing (4):

 ->A vehicular phase is defined as a phase that is allocated to one or more vehicular traffic movements, as timed by the controller unit.
 
 ->A pedestrian phase is defined as a traffic phase allocated to pedestrian traffic that may provide a pedestrian indication either concurrent with one or more vehicular phases, or separate from all vehicular phases.
 
 ->A traffic phase is defined as the green, change, and clearance intervals in a cycle assigned to specified movement(s) of traffic.
 
 ->A cycle is defined as the total time to complete one sequence of signalization for all movements at an intersection. In an actuated controller unit, the cycle is a complete sequence of all signal indications.
 
As can be seen in Figure 3, left-turn movements are assigned odd number phases, while through movements are assigned to even number phases. In this example, the southbound left-turn movement is protected and is associated with phase 5. The right-turn movements are not typically assigned to separate phases. For example, the westbound right-turn movement is compatible with the westbound through movement and thus shares phase 4.

Typically, a pedestrian movement is associated with the concurrent vehicular phase running parallel and adjacent to it. 

As indicated earlier, this phase may include the concurrent right-turn movement that is associated with the through movement.Figure 3, pedestrians crossing the northern leg of the intersection are assigned the concurrent westbound vehicular phase (phase 4), which conflicts with the eastbound left turn (phase 3), this is further described in the next section. The operation of a concurrent phase is influenced by both the vehicular and pedestrian movements that it serves.

The diagram above illustrates how vehicle and pedestrian movements interact in a four-legged intersection in which the major road runs north and south and the minor road runs east and west. The phases assigned to each movement in a conventional eight phase control approach. Vehicle movements include through, right-turn, and left-turns on each approach. Pedestrian movements include crossings on each of the four legs. By convention, through movements are assigned even phase designations, and left-turn movements are assigned odd phases designations. In the illustrated example, left turn phases are numbered one, three, five, and seven for left turns originating from the south, west, north, and east respectively. The through movement phases are numbered two, four, six and eight for through movements originating from the north, east, south and west respectively. Right turn phases are combined with their respective through movement, but must yield to any permitted pedestrian movement. Pedestrian phases run concurrent with through phases. Pedestrian crossings on the west leg run concurrent with southbound vehicle through movements, crossing on the north leg are concurrent with westbound through movements, and so on.

# Ring-and-Barrier Diagrams
 The ring identifies phases that may operate one after another and are typically conflicting phases organized in a particular order. For instance, it may be desirable to separate the traffic traveling through the intersection in the northbound direction from the southbound left turn movement. A change interval and clearance time is used to separate that movement in time.

In Figure 4, a “barrier” would be used to separate the east-west movements from north-south movements to avoid operating conflicting movements at the same time. They are also used to define a relationship between the rings to assure compatible movements. The barrier represents a reference point in the cycle at which a phase in each ring has reached a point of termination; both rings must cross the barrier simultaneously.

The time sequence of phases can be described using a ring and barrier diagram. Some common rules for number phases at an intersection (which are applicable to the diagram) are provided in the following list, which assumes leading left turns and separate left-turn phases.

Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 are assigned to Ring 1. Phases 5, 6, 7, and 8 are assigned to Ring 2.
Phases 1, 2, 5, and 6 are assigned to Barrier 1. Phases 3,4,7, and 8 are assigned to Barrier 2.
A phase pair contains two phases within the same ring and barrier that cannot be displayed concurrently. Examples of phase pairs include 1+2, 5+6, 3+4, and 7+8. Phases within a phase pair can be reversed (e.g. 2+1, 6+5, etc.) Phase pairs within the same barrier must end simultaneously (i.e., end at the barrier). For example, phase pairs 1+2 and 5+6 must end simultaneously at the end of barrier 1 and phase pairs 3+4 and 7+8 must end simultaneously at the end of barrier 2.
Phase pair 1+2 can operate concurrently with phase pair 5+6. Phase pair 3+4 can operate concurrently with phase pair 7+8. These phase pairs are also known as concurrency groups because they can time together.
One common practice is to assign phases 2 and 6 to the major street movements and the phases on the other side of the barrier to the minor road movements. Another practice is to define this by direction (phase 4 may be the most northerly pointed phase).
An example ring diagram is shown in Figure 4-4. The sequence of phases is shown as they occur in time, proceeding from left to right. The figure illustrates a phase sequence with left-turn movements leading the opposing through movements on both the major and minor streets. The diagram shows phase 1 and 5 ending at the same time, but they operate independently and can end at different times. The subsequent phase (phases 2 and 6 respectively) may begin once the previous phase has used its time. Once the barrier is crossed phases 3 and 7 operate followed by phases 4 and 8. The cycle ends with the completion of phases 4 and 8.

 All movements on the street are served (vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians) in one direction during one phase, and all movements on the cross street during the other phase. It should be noted that it is common practice to assign pedestrians to a through traffic movement, with the underlying assumption that a motorist or bicyclist making a right turn must yield to pedestrians as per most Uniform Vehicle Code (5). However, care should be exercised with this concurrent pedestrian phasing approach when there are exclusive right-turn lanes with high right turn volumes (6].

This diagram illustrates the ring-barrier diagram for the intersection of two one way streets.

This diagram illustrates the ring-barrier diagram for the intersection of two one way streets. The diagram consists of a one row by two column matrix representing of one ring with two phases.

The initial phase allows traffic from the east leg to pass through the intersection and pedestrians to cross on the north leg concurrently. The last phase allows traffic from the north leg to pass through the intersection and pedestrians to cross on the west leg.

In this example, the left-turning movements are either non-existent or prohibited (phase 2) or are protected (phase 4). 

Assignment of phase numbers to signalized intersections is somewhat arbitrary based on historical design principles, but there are some rules that have been applied to standardize operation.

Depending on the complexity of the intersection, 2 to 8 phases are typically used, although some controllers can provide up to 40 phases to serve complex intersections or sets of intersections. Developing an appropriate phasing plan begins with determining the left-turn phasing type at the intersection. Section 4.4 presents some of the guidance related to selection of appropriate left turn phasing based on traffic volumes and safety experience.

# Protected-Permissive Left-Turn Phasing

Guidelines for Selecting Left-Turn Phasing
A variety of guidelines exist that have been developed to indicate conditions where the benefits of a left-turn phase typically outweigh its adverse impact to intersection operation. Many of these guidelines indicate that a left-turn phase can be justified based on consideration of several factors that ultimately tie back to the operational or safety benefits derived. These factors include:

Left-turn and opposing through volumes
Number of opposing through lanes
Cycle length
Speed of opposing traffic
Sight distance
Crash history
The flowchart shown in Figure 4-11 can be used to assist in the determination of whether a left-turn phase is needed and whether the operational mode should be protected or protected-permissive.

These guidelines were derived from a variety of sources (8;9). Application of the flowchart requires the separate evaluation of each left-turn movement on the subject road.

# PEDESTRIAN PHASING
Pedestrian movements are typically served concurrently with the adjacent through movement phase at an intersection. 

This is done to simplify the operation of the intersection primarily and is largely a legacy issue in our application of signal logic and control. Typical application of pedestrian operation puts pedestrians in conflict with right-turning vehicles and left-turning vehicles that operate in a permissive mode, by inviting their movement at the same time. There are specific measures that can be used to mitigate this potential conflict, three common options include:

Leading pedestrian interval. A leading pedestrian interval starts a few seconds before the adjacent through movement phase. This allows pedestrians to establish a presence in the crosswalk and thereby reduce conflicts with turning vehicles. 

This option supports improved safety for pedestrians by allowing them increased visibility within the intersection and is applicable to intersections where there are significant pedestrian-vehicle conflicts (13).

Lagging pedestrian interval. A lagging pedestrian interval option operates similarly to a leading pedestrian interval, except that the pedestrian walk interval starts several seconds after the adjacent through movement phase. This option allows a waiting right-turn queue to clear before the pedestrian walk indication is presented and reduces conflicts with right-turning vehicles.

It is applicable to intersections where there is: (1) a high right-turn volume and (2) either an exclusive right-turn lane (or lanes) or the two intersecting roads have one-way traffic (14).

Exclusive pedestrian phase (also “pedestrian scramble” or “Barnes’ Dance”) As shown in Figure 4-14c, an exclusive pedestrian phase dedicates an additional phase for the exclusive use of all pedestrians. This additional phase is configured such that no vehicular movements are served concurrently with pedestrian traffic. During this phase, pedestrians can cross any of the intersection legs and may even be allowed to cross the intersection in a diagonal path. 

This type of phasing has an advantage of reducing conflicts between right-turning vehicles and pedestrians, but it comes at a penalty of reduced vehicular capacity and longer cycle lengths (which increases delay to all users).
